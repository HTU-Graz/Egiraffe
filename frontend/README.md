# Egiraffe Frontend

The frontend of Egiraffe is written in [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Development

Install the dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/):

```zsh
# In the frontend directory
pnpm i
```

To start the development server, run:

```zsh
# Without opening the browser:
pnpm dev # or pnpm start
# or to open the browser automatically
pnpm dev --open # or pnpm start --open
```

This will launch the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development server on port 3000.
